//The store of the data.
{
tableu[1-5]://5 difrent piles in the tablue each with a list of cards
foundation[1-4]: // 4 diffrent foundations
stock: //cards in the stock
waste: //cards in the waste
}

When I move a card to a section of the board how do I know where to remove it from and where to add it to?
need to know:
1) what card it is im moving.i.e index of the card (this is done by using position)
2) where the card is.ie tablue1,tableu2,stock,foundation1
